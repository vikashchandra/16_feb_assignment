    "Q.4. What is DQL? Explain SELECT with an example.\n",
    "Solution:\n",
    "DQL stands for Data Query Language, which is a subset of\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) used for querying and\n",
    "retrieving data from a relational database management \n",
    "system (RDBMS). DQL primarily consists of the SELECT\n",
    "statement, which allows you to retrieve data from one \n",
    "or more database tables. It is one of the fundamental \n",
    "components of SQL and is widely used in database operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic syntax of the SELECT statement in SQL is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "sql code\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT column1, column2, ...\n",
    "FROM table_name\n",
    "WHERE condition;\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an explanation of the various components of the \n",
    "SELECT statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT: This keyword specifies the columns you want to \n",
    "retrieve from the database table.\n",
    "\n",
    "column1, column2, ...: These are the names of the columns \n",
    "you want to select. You can list multiple columns separated \n",
    "by commas. You can also use the wildcard character '*' \n",
    "to select all columns from the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "FROM: This keyword specifies the table from which you want \n",
    "to retrieve data.\n",
    "\n",
    "table_name: This is the name of the database table from \n",
    "which you want to retrieve data.\n",
    "\n",
    "WHERE: This is an optional keyword that allows you to filter\n",
    "the data based on a specified condition. Rows that satisfy\n",
    "the condition will be included in the result set.\n",
    "\n",
    "condition: This is the condition that specifies which rows \n",
    "to include in the result. It is often expressed using \n",
    "comparison operators like =, <, >, <=, >=, or logical \n",
    "operators like AND, OR, and NOT.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of using the SELECT statement to retrieve \n",
    "data from a hypothetical \"employees\" table:\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming the \"employees\" table has the following columns:\n",
    "\"employee_id,\" \"first_name,\" \"last_name,\" \"job_title,\" and\n",
    "\"salary,\" you could use the following SQL query to retrieve\n",
    "the names and job titles of all employees with a salary \n",
    "greater than $50,000:\n",
    "\n",
    "sql code\n",

    "FROM employees\n",
    "WHERE salary > 50000;\n",
