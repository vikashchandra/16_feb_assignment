    "Q.3. What is DML? Explain INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE\n",
    "with an example.\n",
    "Solution:\n",
    "DDL stands for Data Definition Language, which is a subset \n",
    "of SQL (Structured Query Language) used to define, manage, and \n",
    "modify the structure of a database. DDL statements are used\n",
    "to create, modify, and delete database objects, such as tables,\n",
    "indexes, and constraints. Here's an explanation of the DDL \n",
    "statements CREATE, DROP, ALTER, and TRUNCATE with examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE: The CREATE statement is used to create new database\n",
    "objects, such as tables, views, indexes, and constraints.\n",
    "It defines the structure and initial characteristics of the \n",
    "object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Creating a new table named \"Employees\" with columns\n",
    "for employee information.\n",
    "\n",
    "sql code\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE TABLE Employees (\n",
    "    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    FirstName VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "    LastName VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "    HireDate DATE\n",
    ");\n",
    "\n",
    "DROP: The DROP statement is used to delete existing database\n",
    "objects, such as tables, views, indexes, and constraints. \n",
    "Once dropped, the object and its data are permanently removed \n",
    "from the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Dropping the \"Employees\" table created in the previous\n",
    "example.\n",
    "\n",
    "sql code\n",
    "\n",
    "DROP TABLE Employees;\n",
    "\n",
    "ALTER: The ALTER statement is used to modify the structure of \n",
    "an existing database object. You can use it to add, modify,\n",
    "or delete columns, change data types, or add constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Adding a new column \"Salary\" to the \"Employees\" table.\n",
    "\n",
    "sql code\n",
    "\n",
    "ALTER TABLE Employees\n",
    "ADD Salary DECIMAL(10, 2);\n",
    "\n",
    "TRUNCATE: The TRUNCATE statement is used to remove all the rows \n",
    "from a table, but it retains the table structure and definition.\n",
    "Unlike DELETE, which removes rows one by one and logs each\n",
    "deletion, TRUNCATE is faster and more efficient for removing\n",
    "all data from a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Removing all records from the \"Employees\" table.\n",
    "\n",
    "sql code\n",
    "\n",
    "TRUNCATE TABLE Employees;\n",
