    "Q.7. Give the order of execution of SQL clauses in an SQL query.\n",
    "Solution:\n",
    "In a standard SQL query, the clauses are generally executed\n",
    "in a specific order. Here is the typical order of execution \n",
    "for the clauses in an SQL query:\n",
    "\n",
    "FROM: This clause specifies the tables from which data is \n",
    "to be retrieved. It is the first clause processed, and it \n",
    "identifies the data source.\n",
    "\n",
    "WHERE: The WHERE clause is used to filter the rows from\n",
    "the tables specified in the FROM clause. It is applied \n",
    "after the FROM clause and before the other clauses.\n",
    "\n",
    "GROUP BY: If you are using aggregate functions like SUM,\n",
    "COUNT, AVG, etc., the GROUP BY clause is used to group \n",
    "rows that have the same values in specified columns. \n",
    "The grouping is done before any aggregate functions are\n",
    "applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "HAVING: The HAVING clause is used in combination with\n",
    "GROUP BY and filters the grouped rows based on aggregate\n",
    "values (e.g., SUM, COUNT). It is similar to the WHERE \n",
    "clause but is used after grouping.\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT: The SELECT clause specifies the columns you want \n",
    "to retrieve. It operates after the previous clauses have \n",
    "filtered and grouped the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "DISTINCT: If you are using the DISTINCT keyword, it is\n",
    "applied to the selected columns to eliminate duplicate rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "ORDER BY: The ORDER BY clause is used to sort the result\n",
    "set based on one or more columns. It is applied after all\n",
    "the previous clauses have been executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "LIMIT/OFFSET: These clauses are often used for pagination\n",
    "and controlling the number of rows returned in the result\n",
    "set. They are applied after all the other clauses have been\n",
    "executed.\n",
