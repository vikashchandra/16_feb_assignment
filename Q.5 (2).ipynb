    "Q.5. Explain Primary Key and Foreign Key.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "Primary Key and Foreign Key are fundamental concepts in\n",
    "relational databases, and they are used to establish \n",
    "relationships between tables and ensure data integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Primary Key: A Primary Key is a column (or a set of columns)\n",
    "in a relational database table that uniquely identifies each\n",
    "row or record in the table. It serves as a unique identifier\n",
    "for each row, ensuring that no two rows have the same values\n",
    "in the primary key column(s). \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some key points about primary keys:\n",
    "\n",
    "Uniqueness: Every value in the primary key column(s) must \n",
    "be unique within the table. This uniqueness constraint\n",
    "ensures that each row can be easily and uniquely identified.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-null: The values in the primary key column(s) cannot be\n",
    "NULL, meaning they must have a value for every row.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Integrity: Primary keys help maintain data integrity \n",
    "by preventing duplicate or inconsistent data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indexes: Database management systems typically create an\n",
    "index on the primary key column(s) to enhance query\n",
    "performance when searching for specific rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Auto-incrementing: Primary keys are often auto-incrementing,\n",
    "meaning that the database system generates a unique value\n",
    "for the primary key for each new row automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of a Primary Key:\n",
    "In a \"Students\" table, the \"student_id\" column can be the\n",
    "primary key. This ensures that each student has a unique\n",
    "identifier, and no two students share the same \"student_id.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Foreign Key:\n",
    "A Foreign Key is a column (or a set of columns) in one table\n",
    "that is used to establish a link between the data in two tables.\n",
    "The foreign key in one table is linked to the primary key in\n",
    "another table, creating a referential relationship. Here are\n",
    "some key points about foreign keys:\n",
    "\n",
    "Referential Integrity: Foreign keys help maintain referential \n",
    "integrity by ensuring that the data in one table corresponds\n",
    "to data in another table. It enforces data consistency and \n",
    "relationships between tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relationships: Foreign keys establish relationships between \n",
    "tables, allowing you to connect data in meaningful ways.\n",
    "For example, you can link a \"student_id\" in a \"Grades\" \n",
    "table to the \"student_id\" in a \"Students\" table, creating \n",
    "a link between students and their grades.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cascading Actions: Foreign keys can define actions to be \n",
    "taken when data in the referenced table (the one with the\n",
    "primary key) is modified. These actions can include cascading \n",
    "deletes or updates, maintaining data integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of a Foreign Key:\n",
    "In a database with \"Students\" and \"Grades\" tables, the \n",
    "\"student_id\" column in the \"Grades\" table can be a foreign\n",
    "key linked to the \"student_id\" column in the \"Students\" table.\n",
    "This establishes a relationship between a student's grades \n",
    "and the student's information.\n",
