    "Q.1.  What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL \n",
    "databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "A database is a structured collection of data that is\n",
    "organized and stored for efficient retrieval and manipulation.\n",
    "Databases are essential in many applications and systems,\n",
    "serving as a means to store, manage, and access data.\n",
    "They come in various forms and are used in a wide range of \n",
    "contexts, from simple personal record-keeping to large-scale\n",
    "enterprise systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a differentiation between SQL (Relational) and NoSQL \n",
    "databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. SQL (Relational) Databases:\n",
    "Data Structure: SQL databases are also known as relational \n",
    "databases because they use a tabular structure to store data. \n",
    "Data is organized into tables with rows and columns, where\n",
    "each row represents a record, and each column represents an\n",
    "attribute or field.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Schema: SQL databases have a fixed schema, which means\n",
    "that you define the structure of the database, including the\n",
    "tables, columns, and data types, in advance. Changes to the\n",
    "schema can be complex and require careful planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Query Language: SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to \n",
    "interact with relational databases. SQL is a powerful and \n",
    "standardized language for querying, updating, and manipulating \n",
    "data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. ACID Transactions: SQL databases typically support ACID \n",
    "(Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) transactions, \n",
    "ensuring data integrity and consistency. This is essential for\n",
    "applications that require strong data consistency and \n",
    "reliability, such as financial systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Scalability: SQL databases are traditionally considered to\n",
    "be vertically scalable, meaning that you can increase their \n",
    "performance by upgrading the hardware resources (CPU, memory,\n",
    "etc.) of a single server. This can be costly and has practical\n",
    "limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Use Cases: SQL databases are well-suited for applications\n",
    "where data integrity and complex queries are paramount, such\n",
    "as financial systems, e-commerce platforms, and applications\n",
    "that require complex joins and transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL Databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data Structure: NoSQL databases use various data models,\n",
    "including document, key-value, column-family, and graph. Each \n",
    "data model has a different way of organizing and storing data,\n",
    "but they all allow for flexible, schema-less data storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Schema: NoSQL databases are schema-less or schema-flexible,\n",
    "meaning you can add fields to records/documents without the\n",
    "need to modify a predefined schema. This flexibility is\n",
    "beneficial for applications with evolving data requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Query Language: NoSQL databases have their own query\n",
    "languages tailored to their data models. The query languages\n",
    "are typically less expressive than SQL, but they are optimized\n",
    "for specific use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. ACID Transactions: NoSQL databases vary in their support \n",
    "for ACID transactions. Some provide strong consistency,\n",
    "while others prioritize scalability and offer eventual \n",
    "consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Scalability: NoSQL databases are typically designed to be \n",
    "horizontally scalable, meaning you can add more servers to\n",
    "distribute the load. This makes them well-suited for\n",
    "applications with high read and write loads, such as \n",
    "social media platforms and real-time analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Use Cases: NoSQL databases are commonly used in applications\n",
    "that require high scalability, low-latency access, and can \n",
    "tolerate some level of data inconsistency. Examples include\n",
    "content management systems, real-time analytics, and IoT \n",
    "applications.\n",
